Movie Info Retriever

DISCLAIMER: This software is provided under the GPL (see GPL.txt included in this distribution, or

risk, and is provided as-is, with no warranty.

This is a simple program to retrieve info for video files that you may have.  The intent is to be able to use
this software to create a legal backup, of hard-copy media you may have, while also retrieving the proper
title, description, images, production information, etc. for that title.

The simplified roadmap for this software also includes Serial and Episodic content, though those are not currently
supported.  Also, other media information providers (for example, but not specifically, IMDB) might be included if
licensing can be worked out.

Thanks
