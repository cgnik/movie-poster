General flow

1. Read directory (or command line options) to find all movie files
    - also find image files there
    - Add command-line options for specifying which movie file, which image, which movie id, etc.?
2. Figure out which movie file need info (images, descriptions, etc.)
3. Figure out movie IDs for each movie
    - may be specified in external file
4. Find all images for the discovered/specified movie IDs
5. Sift through found images to figure out which image is the "right image"
    - filter based on language, image size
6. Call to retrieve images that we still want
7. Name the retrieved image appropriately to go with the movie file on disk
